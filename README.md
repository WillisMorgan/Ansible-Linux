# Ansible-RHEL Playbooks

---
## Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible website.

### Ansible playbooks created by me overtime for server and configuration management. Please feel free to correct any mistakes you find and commit your changes ###
